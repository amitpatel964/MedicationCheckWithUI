# MedicationCheckWithUI
Similar program as MedicationCheck, but this utilizes JavaFX in order to show the UI and allow the user to directly input their medications and see the table.

Basic functionality is complete, but work still needs to be done for a fea more extra features. One of these features is to let users change the category of a medication if it is not in the .csv file right away instead of having to remove the medicine from the other category and then putting it in the correct category.
